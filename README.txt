# For testing, use the testcases in Test Files.zip in ExampleProjects on TRACS AND specify the microwave example for the given property in mchPeled.zip in the same folder on TRACS. During the presentation I will ask you to run at least the critical section testcase (Model 4 in Test Files.zip) and the microwave example.

# The application must check that the given state ID does exist in the input Kripke structure.
Example result output (either in a corresponding GUI textfield or console): “Property {the given CTL formula} does not hold in state s4” (assuming that property was to be checked for state s4).

The archive file should contain:
1. Description of acceptance testcases
2. Description of execution of acceptance testcases illustrated with screenshots of all the windows and
pop-up windows of the system and console output along an acceptance testcase
3. UML class diagram for the software system
4. Source code (archive of directory structure starting from modelCheckCTL dir)
